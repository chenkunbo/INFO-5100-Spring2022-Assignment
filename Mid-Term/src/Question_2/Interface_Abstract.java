/*
* Question 2: Difference between abstract class and interface
* An abstract class permits you to make functionality that subclasses
* can implement or override whereas an interface only permits you to state
* functionality but not to implement it.
* A class can extend only one abstract class while a class can implement multiple interfaces.
